## Distinguished elements

> **`Zero`**`(K :: FldPadExact)`

> `-> FldPadExactElt`

The zero element of `K`.

> **`One`**`(K :: FldPadExact)`

> `-> FldPadExactElt`

The one element of `K`.

> **`UniformizingElement`**`(K :: FldPadExact)`

> `-> FldPadExactElt`

A uniformizing element of `K`. For prime fields, it is the prime. For totally ramified extensions, it is a root of the defining polynomial. For unramified extensions, it is the uniformizing element of the base field.

> **`InertiaGenerator`**`(K :: FldPadExact)`

> `-> FldPadExactElt`

A unit of `K` whose residue class generates the residue class field of `K` over its prime subfield.

> `K.1`

> **`Generator`**`(K :: FldPadExact)`

> `-> FldPadExactElt`

A generator of `K` over its base field. `K` must be an extension. It is a root of the defining polynomial.

> **`PrimitiveElement`**`(L :: FldPadExact, K :: FldPadExact)`

> `-> FldPadExactElt`

A generator of `L` over `K`. If the extension is trivial, returns 1. If `L` is defined as a direct extension of `K`, returns `Generator(L)`. If the extension is unramified, returns `InertiaGenerator(L)`. If the extension is totally ramified, returns `UniformizingElement(L)`. Otherwise, returns `InertiaGenerator(L)+UniformizingElement(L)`.

## From subfields

> `K ! x`

> **`elt`**`<K | x>`

> `-> FldPadExactElt`

Creates an element of `K` from `x`, which must be one of the following

  * An integer or rational.
  * An element of a subfield of `K`.
  * If `K` is a completion or an extension of a completion, an element of the global field.

## From vectors

> `K ! [x1, ..., xn]`

> **`elt`**`<K | x1, ..., xn>`

> **`elt`**`<K | [x1, ..., xn]>`

> `-> FldPadExactElt`

If `K` is an extension of degree `n`, interprets `x1, ..., xn` as coefficients of an element of `K` considered as a vector in the basis generated by powers of `K.1`.

## Random

> **`RandomUnit`**`(K :: FldPadExact, [v :: RngIntElt])`

> `-> FldPadExactElt`

A random element of `K` of valuation `v` (or 0 if not given).

> **`RandomInteger`**`(K :: FldPadExact)`

> `-> FldPadExactElt`

A random element of `K` of valuation at least 0.

> **`Random`**`(K :: FldPadExact, v :: RngIntElt)`

> `-> FldPadExactElt`

A random element of `K` of valuation at least `v`.

## Via internal representation

> `K ! <init :: FldPadElt, mkUpdate :: UserProgram>`

> `-> FldPadExactElt`

Creates an element of `K` by setting its internal representation directly. The initial approximation is `init`. If `x` is the element being created, then `mkUpdate` is a `function(x)` which returns a `function(apr :: Val_FldPadExactElt) -> XPGetter` whose return value, when evaluated, increases the absolute precision of `x` to `apr` (which is usually achieved via the `Update` intrinsic, below).

> **`Update`**`(x :: FldPadExactElt, xx :: FldPadElt)`

Updates the current approximation of `x` to `xx`. Requires that `xx` and the current approximation of `x` be weakly equal.
